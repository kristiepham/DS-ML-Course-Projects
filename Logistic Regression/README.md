# Logistic Regression Projects
In this section, I have completed two projects demonstrating the Logistic Regression Machine Learning algorithm; **Titanic** and **Advertising**.

## Titanic Project
Introduced in the lecture at a very high level. I was interested so I decided to explore it further on my own. In this project, I was given Titanic passenger data and based off of the features given, I analyze and create an algorithm that predicts whether a passenger survives or not.

## Advertising Project
Given advertising data, I create a model to predict whether a given user clicks on an advertisement or not.
