# DS-ML-Course-Projects

Completed projects demonstrating my application of various machine learning algorithms from the course 'Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp', instructed by Jose Portilla of Pierian Data using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Python Libraries
- NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, TensorFlow, Keras

## Projects
1. Linear Regression
  - Ecommerce Customers: predict a customer's annual amount spent at a retail store
2. Logistic Regression
  - Titanic: predict whether a passenger survives the sinking of the Titanic
  - Advertising: predict whether a user clicks on an ad
3. K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
  - Anonymized Data: predict an unknown given target class on classified/masked data
4. Decision Trees and Random Forests
  - LendingClub: predict whether a borrower will fully pay back their loan
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Iris Flower Species: classify the species of iris flowers
6. K Means Clustering
  - Private vs Public School Clustering: classify a school as either public or private
7. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Breast Cancer PCA: reduce dimensionality of data to two principal components in order to prepare data for a model
8. Recommender Systems
  - MovieLens: recommend movies using a simpple and content-based recommender
9. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Yelp Reviews: classify Yelp reviews into star rating categories
10. Artifical Neural Networks
  - LendingClub: use keras and tensorflow to build a ANN to determine whether a borrower will fully pay their loan
